# Music and Emotions: Unraveling the Connection

## **Introduction**: 
This study, employing Natural Language Processing (NLP), delves into the intricate relationship between music and human emotions, examining diverse emotional responses to different musical genres, exploring music's profound influence on human existence, and presenting key findings in a comprehensive report.

## **Data**: 
We conducted linguistic analysis using Genius.com song lyrics, focusing on the 'genre' and 'lyrics' attributes to examine sentiment variations across music genres in songs released after 1900, as shown in Figure 1.

## **Methods**:
In the study's initial phases, we rigorously cleaned and filtered data for enhanced quality, focusing on country, rap, rhythm and blues, pop, and rock genres due to their societal significance. Insights into song frequency and tokens across these genres are detailed in Figure 2. Our text tokenization, word cloud visualization (Table 3), lexical diversity analysis, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis, and sentiment analysis adhere to best practices, ensuring meticulous data preparation and a comprehensive evaluation of statistical significance within music genres.

## **Results**:

In our analysis, we discern varying levels of lexical diversity among music genres (Table 4). Rap songs, renowned for their intricate wordplay, exhibit the highest degree of lexical diversity. In contrast, country songs, often characterized by simplicity, showcase the lowest lexical diversity. These findings underscore the diverse linguistic styles prevalent in the music industry, highlighting how each genre forges a unique connection with its audience through lyrical content.

Our analysis also unveils intriguing insights into the most distinctive words for each music genre, offering a glimpse into their unique linguistic characteristics (Table 5). For example, rap features words like 'guap' and 'choppa,' emphasizing slang usage, while country music includes 'redneck' and 'honky,' aligning with its rural life focus.

Furthermore, the incorporation of NRC sentiment analysis into our study reveals insights into the emotional depth of song lyrics (Table 6). Across all genres, 'fear,' 'anger,' 'sadness,' and 'trust' are prevalent, with 'disgust,' 'anticipation,' and 'surprise' appearing less frequently. Surprisingly, 'surprise' emerges as the least prevalent sentiment. Our analysis also consistently reveals a higher frequency of negative words compared to positive ones across genres (Table 7). These findings reflect the multifaceted emotional landscape of songwriting, without implying a negative impact on listeners.

## **Discussion**:

Our sentiment analysis across music genres suggests that there isn't a significant difference in sentiment expression when considering a wide range of genres. This result, initially surprising, may be attributed to several factors, including the prevalence of universal emotional themes in songwriting, shared songwriting techniques among genres, and the inherent subjectivity of sentiment analysis. These findings open up intriguing avenues for further research, particularly in the development of sentiment analysis tools capable of capturing the nuances of songwriting, including non-English words, slang, and cultural expressions.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of our study. The presence of non-English words within lyrics and the incorporation of slang introduced challenges to the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Additionally, sentiment analysis tools and lexicons inherently involve subjectivity, potentially categorizing words differently based on source and context. These limitations underscore the need for more robust sentiment analysis methods tailored to the complexities of song lyrics. Despite these challenges, our study offers valuable insights into the emotional landscape of song lyrics and paves the way for future research at the intersection of music and sentiment analysis.
